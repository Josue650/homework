# Homework 1
Written HW #1 How Does The Internet Work ?, What do HTML, CSS, and JavaScript do ?, What is the difference between backend and frontend ? Due Tuesday Week 10 Day 1

-Q1: The internet works with many diffrent parts. HTML is what is displayed to a page, JS lets the user do something ex if the user clicks something do this if the user types something do this etc... Last to make the page look appealing and pretty we use CSS. One thing we learned to day is that servers are also part of how the internet works.

-Q2: Like i staited in my last answer HTML takes care of whats presented to the page, that can be headings buttons, a bunch of text like a paragraph explaining something. JavaScript handles all the functions. When a user types his name in show a input for the last name. When the user clicks submit take me to the next page etc. Css makes everything look pretty a red background or all the text to be white or black or green. Css makes the page not look boring.

-Q3: Front end is making the webpage, making sure it works and and all the functionality and styling is up and working. Back end requires the user communicating with the server, when the user asks for something ex. google they input I want the top 5 restaurants in my area, the server will send back the information for all the matches of the top 5 restaurants.
