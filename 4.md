* Written HW What is Big O Notation? Contrast Big O with Omega and Theta. Show 1 Code Example Each Of Linear Time Complexity and Quadratic Time Complexity.

* Q1. Bi O notation is define as upper bound and upper bound on an algorithm is the most amount of time required ( the worst case performance).

Big oh notation is used to describe asymptotic upper bound.

Mathematically: Big Oh is 0 <= f(n) <= Cg(n) for all n >= n0

* Q2. It is define as upper bound and upper bound on an algorithm is the most amount of time required ( the worst case performance).
Big oh notation is used to describe asymptotic upper bound.

Mathematically: Big Omega is 0 <= Cg(n) <= f(n) for all n >= n0
