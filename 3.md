# Homework 3

* Written HW #3 Explain what Index New, Create and Show Routes Do
Give an example written in a Markdown Code Block

* Q1.
- Index route is used to display a list of whatever ex fruit or vegatable.

app.get('/veggies', (req, res) => {
    Veggie.find({}, (err, foundVeggies) => {

        })
    })

- New route displays the HTML form for creating a veggie.

app.get('/veggies/new', (req, res) => {
    res.render('veggies/New')
})

- Create route creates the new veggie in our case, but it can be new post, new account like an email etc.

app.post('/veggies', (req, res) => {
    Veggies.create(req.body, (err, createVeggie) => {
    })
})

- Show route will display the specifiv veggie, if it were anything else like a photo, or new account profile. The reson its specific because it looks it up by id. Everyitems id is unique.

app.get('/veggies:id', (req, res) => {
    Veggie.findById(req.params.id, (err, foundVeggie) => {

    })
})
