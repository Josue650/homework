# Q1. What are all the JavaScript Data Types?
In Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data. The five most basic types of data are strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null.

# Q2. What is the Difference Between Const Let and Var? Consider Scope ... Give an example
var has function scope when declared inside a function and global scope when outside. let and const has block scope. let variable can be reassigned contrary to const . But watch out, a variable declared with const is not immutable.

# Q3. Pass By Value vs Pass By Reference? Why would you say a String is pass by value/ or a value type? Why is an object a reference type?
Pass by value sends a copy of the data stored in the variable you specify, and pass by reference sends a direct link to the variable itself. So if you pass a variable by reference and then change the variable inside the block you passed it into, the original variable will be changed.

# Q4. What do Map , Filter and Reduce do? Do they mutate the array you call them on?
The functions map(), filter(), and reduce() all do the same thing: They each take a function and a list of elements, and then return the result of applying the function to each element in the list. As previously stated, Python has built-in functions like map(), filter(), and reduce().

# Q5. What are all the Falsey Values in JavaScript? Why do you think this is important to know?
A falsy value is something which evaluates to FALSE, for instance when checking a variable. There are only six falsey values in JavaScript: undefined , null , NaN , 0 , "" (empty string), and false of course.

# Q6. What are Async and Await?
The async keyword is used to define an asynchronous function, which returns a AsyncFunction object. The await keyword is used to pause async function execution until a Promise is fulfilled, that is resolved or rejected, and to resume execution of the async function after fulfillment.

# Q7. What is an async function?
An async function will return a different reference, whereas Promise.resolve returns the same reference if the given value is a promise. It can be a problem when you want to check the equality of a promise and a return value of an async function.

# Q8. What are try and catch?
The try...catch statement is comprised of a try block and either a catch block, a finally block, or both. The code in the try block is executed first, and if it throws an exception, the code in the catch block will be executed.
